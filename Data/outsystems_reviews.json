            "headline": "OutSystems raised the state of our business with a fast approach, tackling down old issues",
            "summary": "In the last months, OutSystems has become our primary development tool. Our company is a huge producer of footwear and our development in OutSystems is supporting the construction of a large set of applications in these areas:\n\nFactory and production-level systems (industrial apps)\n\nThere are already many applications built to provide information to our offices and for production control of factory processes, simulation, and machine setup. In addition to the already running analytics apps, we are in the process of integrating OutSystems with machines' programmable logic controllers (PLCs). We believe that OutSystems can support factory-level systems that respond quickly. Beginning with the less critical processes, we have already started to build web/mobile applications to be used on the assembly lines and loading docks in the distribution center.",
            "liked_most": "* Easy and low-code web/mobile development: Reduces the manual labor in compiling and deploying applications and generating procedural code (by reducing development bureaucracy/processes, resulting in real gains). The LifeTime Server approach, requiring just a few steps to publish applications in production environments, is fantastic.\n\n* High reuse of components and business logic: Once built, web/mobile components can be reused in all new developments. In addition, the OutSystems Forge is very useful. We can exchange components and even already-built applications, reducing costs to build specific solutions.\n\n* Build-logic becomes simple with a graphic interface: Developers work better with visual support. In a related vein, we are currently studying if, in the near future, an OutSystems environment could be provisioned to non-technical areas to allow them to construct their own applications (supervised by IT, and with good governance and security assessments).\n\n* Stakeholder engagement and satisfaction: In the past, it was difficult to keep our clients (employees and partners) up to date on the development process. There were many promises of application delivery dates which were often not met. With OutSystems, we can develop and share progress and functionalities.\n\n* Integration: With the SOAP and REST APIs and the database connections allowing communication with different data sources, it\u2019s simple and quick to fulfill requirements which demand resources from multiple sources. In this way, the platform provides opportunities for innovative ideas. A simple example is to check transportation costs against rotes using maps and GPS technologies to measure accurate distances.",
            "disliked_most": "There are some features expected in the future that may speed up some processes. But there is a lack of development resources that need implementing. For example, OutSystems does not provide any native reporting resources. All reports must be created with other tools or as a webpage. \n\nAnother issue is the asynchronous processing and multithreading tasks for which the current resources of the platform are very generic and not built for the end-user. Any asynchronous jobs have to be constructed with an end-user dashboard to allow inspection of the status of the activities.",
            "advice": "* When possible, use a cloud environment option rather than a local installation.\n* Negotiate a suitable license with OutSystems, taking into account that the application objects grow quickly.\n* Hire trainers and make sure the development team sets up a proper architecture. If you choose the wrong approach or do not plan appropriate architecture, in a short time you will certainly have a very large rework. \n* It is essential to build an appropriate Canvas.\n* Sometimes, junior developers will perform better with OutSystems, since senior developers often do not adapt to the graphical structural programming. It is not a rule, but some resistance and difficulty of adaptation were noticed.\n* A good practice is to hire an expert consulting company, for a couple weeks, which already uses OutSystems. They will help your development team with basic questions, increasing the pace of learning and making it more effective. \n* OutSystems has a set of metadata and any kind of control is possible, but these structures should be practiced with the developers.\nOutSystems Forge is a very useful place, when starting out, to download components to adapt to your needs.\n* SQL Server is a good default database option for OutSystems. We have never had a problem with it. We recommend using only a single database catalog instead of many.\n* Finally, perhaps the most important tip is regarding development governance. Not only for OutSystems but for all types of development, it is very important to maintain normalized and standardized environments. In a chaotic scene with no effort to have periodic reviews, a low-code platform could create a huge mess and the cost will be paid in the near future.",

While no product has attained that complete 'citizen developer' nirvana, Outsystems is definitely a solid product, and a good force multiplier for an existing development team.  \n\nWe found UI development to be exceptionally speedy, and DevOps processes were quite streamlined as well.  Application logic development still sometimes required hand writing code on the backend, but the ability to easily integrate with XML or RESTful services made that a nonissue.

From the moment you begin learning and using it you find each new thing you learn about it is something that works as you would expect: 1-click deploy really works, and so does environment promotion (development to quality to production), even for database changes. Refactoring is a bliss: whatever the platform can help you there, it will. Overall, it completely takes your attention out of the low-level technical issues (files, scripts, upgrades, lifecycle, ...), so you can focus only on features and code. The main drawback is the granularity of the source code: when you want to promote something between environments, the smallest thing you can promote is a whole module. When you have several features being developed on the same module, with different lifecycles, you have to manage really well how you promote only some of them to production. When you want to reuse code, a mesh of references between modules start to appear, and promoting a single feature, that envolves several modules, each with several features being developed, makes promotion to production take some time, mainly on coordinating all development teams for a \"safe\" promotion to production.",

Given our strong relationship (we employ 2 out of 31 OutSystems MVP programmers and we are the main supplier of platform bugs etc., do most of the referal visits for new customers in the Benelux etc.) we were able to reach an attractive contract pricing which suits the size of our company (120m euro revenues, 130 employees, i.e. SME). Reaching the end of the current contract by the end of 2018 I decided to reach out to OS to already see whether we could extent the contract given we have developed litterally all our systems in OS (except for financial bookkeeping, etc.) and hence the crucial role for our business. OS didn't want to extent if we would not increase our contract directly for the next quarter. After not agreeing to this proposal they send an offer in which we should double the current pricing by the next quarter (which started by receipt of this proposal in 3 working days...) and if we would not agree they would cancel the current contract directly after the end of the contract period. I must admit I never experienced a one-sided canceling of the contract from the supplier. In light of our relationship we are astonished and received similar stories from community, especially from smaller companies which do a lot in OS.",
