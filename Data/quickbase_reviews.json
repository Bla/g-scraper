We've built Quick Base applications to support grant-funded public health research, door-to-door community engagement work by local nonprofits, large-N image coding of employee facilities and furniture use for business, and survey response tracking for dozens of clients. \n\nThe Quick Base API and the Sync feature have allowed us to create integrations with Qualtrics surveys, QuickBooks accounting, and Google Drive folders full of CSVs we export from Stata statistical software. We use the new Quick Base Automations features to automate workflow and creation of related database records, such as pre-populating a sequence of events and a set of subject slots to fill for each research group, along with a sequence of event attendance opportunities when a research subject fills a slot.\n\nQuick Base may not always be the best solution, and it may require support from other tools.

If you're new to this product type, don't just dive in to building one big overengineered mission-critical app, especially not if you're hiring out the work. New users routinely add way too many fields to tables. Focus on learning to design smart relational data models that use more tables and fewer fields to handle as-yet-unforeseen future tasks without major structural changes. Start learning Quick Base by using it as an escape from \"spreadsheet hell\" for smaller applications, and use external consultants to build your experience and culture.
