Also i expect with the introduction of React Native, and the introduction of native apps, a lot of these issues will improve.",

Further, user story management, burn-down charts, application feedback features, environment and performance monitoring tools are all built into the Mendix platform.  You don't need to select individual tools and get them working before you can start development.",

It can expensive if the business requires a small mobile application and all you have is large containers, as such a container is oversized for the application requirement.  You can purchase individual licences but this can be expensive.  The cost of entry for Mendix applications is still cheap but having the same container for a light-weight mobile application and a 10,000 user customer facing portal can be difficult to sell to the business.",
